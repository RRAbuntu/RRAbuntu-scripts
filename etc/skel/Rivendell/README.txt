Welcome to the RRAbuntu v2.0 CD BETA. Note at this point there is no demo option but you can install RRAbuntu. 

Many thanks to Frederick Henderson for the creation of these scripts, Alban Peignier for the creation of the Ubuntu and Debian packages and of course Frederick F. Gleason, Jr. Chief Developer of Paravel Systems for creating Rivendell. Alan Peterson made the Rivendell radio ads.

Double click on shortcut icons on the Desktop.
==========================================
1. To Install RRAbuntu... => Install RRAbuntu
2. After installing...    => Rivendell_Compile.sh
